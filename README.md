During this COVID-19 pandemic, we have been receiving a lot of bad news from all over
the world. How about receive directly on your Whatsapp one good news per day and try to forget
a little bit the other ones?

## Getting Started

This is a simple Python script to send a WhatsApp message using News API and Twilio sandbox.  
To run it every day at a certain time, I added the code on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) installed
- Your API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
- Your sandbox settings from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
- [AWS]()

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
